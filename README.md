# Student.Educational.Outcomes
Machine Learning techniques to identify and evaluate various contributing factors on educational outcomes of students at instituations of higher learning in Portugal.

# Project Overview:
The project focuses on identification of factors in the data that are most significant in prediction of a student dropout, and identification of the most accurate machine learning models for prediction.
 
# Team Members: 
Christopher Murphy, Padmaja Kurumaddali, La Monte Henry Piggy Yarroll

# Reason for Selecting this Topic:
Researchers can leverage this dataset to develop models for predicting dropout and academic success, contributing to the understanding of factors influencing educational outcomes. 

# Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data:
1. What factors influence student dropout?
2. What distinguishable combination of factors could predict a dropout?
3. Which machine learning models provide accurage predictions? 

# Description of Data Source:
The dataset was retrieve from Kaggle at the following page in September 2024:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/mdismielhossenabir/student-s-dropout-and-academic-success

The original source at UCI is here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success

The dataset has 4424 observations with 37 attributes.

The measures can be categorized as demographics about students, student socio-economic information, student academic progress tracking, and information about the external macro-economic environment during student enrollment. The target variable indicates whether a student dropped out or achieved academic success (continued enrollment, or graduation). Academic progress tracking is measured through a multi-step process of credit attainment.

The data spans multiple semesters.  The data comes from educational institutions in Portugal.

# Technologies Used for Analysis:
R and R Studio.  R Packages Used: rpart, caret, arules, Hmisc, cluster, factoextra, randomForest, e1071, stats, nnet.
